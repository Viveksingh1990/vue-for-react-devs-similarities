Intro to Vue for React Devs
===========================

If you have experiences using React, you don’t have to learn Vue.js from scratch like everyone else. You can leverage your React experience to expedite your Vue.js learning progress.

Welcome to Vue.js for React Devs, a pair of courses designed specifically for React developers who want to learn Vue.js efficiently.

Similarities and Differences
----------------------------

Vue and React are very similar because they solve the same problem: _single-page app development with stateful components that are powered by virtual DOM_.

These two technologies are also very different because they solve the problem in different ways. Vue.js is taking a framework-style approach, while React is taking a minimalist approach.

That’s why we’ve divided this learning journey into two courses. Part 1 is about their _similarities_, and Part 2 is about their _differences_.

In this course, about the _similarities **between React and Vue**_, we’ll start with the Vue.js basics where you’ll find that most of the concepts are indeed similar to their React equivalents.

Once you’re done with this course, you can immediately jump into Part 2 to explore the differences. Then, you’ll be able to take everything you’ve learned and start building production-grade Vue.js applications.

The app we’re be building
-------------------------

Throughout the two courses, we’ll be a building this product app:

![Vue product app](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F3.1668104106553.jpg?alt=media&token=bd827cba-d8c4-4cc1-9806-a18e6d616f94)

It’s a single page app (SPA) that shows a product, which you select the color variant you want by hovering one of these circles:

![Single page app in Vue](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F4.1668104109067.jpg?alt=media&token=ae2bede3-a324-4497-8ed5-17b9bc31e9c6)

It could be out of stock for the color you’re interested, in which case, the **Add to Cart** button would not work:

![Single page app in Vue](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F5.1668104112337.jpg?alt=media&token=06680c80-6e53-41c5-913f-33104d9747e1)

But if the color variant is available, you would be able to add it to the cart:

![Single page app in Vue.js](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F6.1668104115368.jpg?alt=media&token=e83250b3-dea9-46b6-859b-f61793c52347)

And then the cart number will get updated:

![Single page app in Vue.js](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F7.1668104118618.jpg?alt=media&token=1d584834-a5ac-4c5f-aecf-1dfa0b962e22)

Additionally, you can also add reviews to the product page by using the form:

![Single page app in Vue.js](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F8.1668104122035.jpg?alt=media&token=7e25c832-dbe4-480b-b296-346d583610ce)

All of these features are implemented on the frontend, with Vue.js.

Follow Along
------------

There are two ways you can follow along:

1.  You can follow the lessons step-by-step to build the app from scratch.
2.  You can also clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Code-Pop/vue-for-react-devs-similarities) for the app and `checkout` the branches for the lessons you’re working on.

If that sounds good to you, let’s start building the app in the next lesson.
